# Module: Security Monitoring & SIEM Fundamentals

## What I Have Learned:
- Core concepts and role of SIEM in modern SOC environments
- Introduction to the Elastic Stack and how it's used for log collection, parsing, and visualization
- Understanding SOC workflows and responsibilities
- Familiarity with the MITRE ATT&CK framework for mapping adversarial behavior
- The process of SIEM use case development and the logic behind detection rules
- Basics of alert triaging and how to handle incidents based on priority and impact

## Practical Experience:
Iâ€™ve worked hands-on with the Elastic Stack and developed several SIEM visualizations to detect suspicious activity:

- ðŸ“Š **Visualization 1**: Failed logon attempts across all users
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization 2**: Failed logon attempts targeting disabled accounts
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization 3**: Successful RDP logons linked to service accounts
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization 4**: User additions/removals from local groups within specific timeframes

These visualizations helped reinforce how detection logic translates into actionable dashboards. I now feel more confident in building use cases based on real-world scenarios and aligning them with the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.

## Completed:
- âœ… SIEM & SOC Definitions
- âœ… Elastic Stack Introduction
- âœ… MITRE ATT&CK & Use Case Mapping
- âœ… Visualization Labs (4 use cases)
- âœ… Triaging Process
- âœ… Skills Assessment

This module gave me a strong foundation in SIEM operations and helped me understand how to apply theoretical knowledge into practical detection strategies.
