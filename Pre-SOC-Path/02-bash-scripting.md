# Module: Introduction to Bash Scripting

## Overview
This module introduced the foundational concepts of Bash scripting. I covered key topics including:

- Variables and arrays
- Conditional statements and branching
- Loops and functions
- Script debugging and error handling

All module requirements have been successfully completed.

## Practical Application
To reinforce my understanding through hands-on practice, I solved over **35 Bash scripting problems** on the Exercism platform.
These exercises deepened my grasp of logic flow and scripting syntax in real-world scenarios.
