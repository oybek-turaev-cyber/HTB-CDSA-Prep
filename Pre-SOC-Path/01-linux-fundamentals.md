# Module: Linux Fundamentals

## Key Information:
This module served as a solid refresher for me, as I’ve been using Linux-based operating systems for over 4 years. My prior experience with command-line tools, file permissions, system navigation, and process management allowed me to move through this content efficiently.

## SELinux and AppArmor:
One particularly valuable part of this module was the introduction to **Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)** and **AppArmor** — both critical for understanding Mandatory Access Control (MAC) in secure environments.

To reinforce the theory, I installed SELinux on a test machine and explored its enforcement and permissive modes. I also configured **AppArmor** profiles to compare how both systems handle process-level confinement.

These practical experiments gave me first-hand insight into how Linux hardening mechanisms work under the hood and how they can prevent privilege escalation or system compromise.

## Reflections:
While the material was mostly familiar, this module helped me connect theoretical access control concepts to real-world applications. Revisiting the fundamentals with a defensive mindset is always valuable, especially when preparing for SOC analyst roles.
